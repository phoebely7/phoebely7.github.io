            <p><a href="https://www.widsconference.org/">WiDS</a> is an initiative founded by faculty members of Stanford University that aims to inspire and educate data scientists
                worldwide, and to support women in the field. I became a <a href="https://www.widsconference.org/ambassadors-2022.html">WiDS Ambassador</a> in 2021 and hosted the inaugural
                Riverside regional event at the Univeristy of California, Riverside. We had women from multiple industries and the academic space join us to share
                their insights and give advice to students in their undergraduate studies. Sessions included a keynote speaker, panels, and R/Python workshops! Due to the success of the 
                first event, we held another WiDS Regional event the following year!

            <p><u><b>Highlander Statistics Society (HiSS)</b></u></p>

            <p> <a href="https://statistics.ucr.edu/clubs-organizations/highlander-statistics-society">HiSS</a> is an undergraduate club designed for 
                students who are majoring in or interested in statistics. Members from various
                academic and personal backgrounds collected and collaborated on hands-on learning opportunities to practice their technical skills, 
                and gain the confidence in data analysis that is needed in the job market. HiSS strives to be an inclusive and supportive
                community by providing both personal and professional resources to help its members thrive in college and their careers.
            </p>

            <p> I was extremely fortunate to have been able to serve as President for two years because I had the time to better develop events,
                fine-tune the coding workshops, and organize the internal side of the club. 
                
                On a personal note, this opportunity helped me grow in numerous ways. Leading a team of five officers taught me valuable lessons 
                in teamwork, communication, and time management. I also had the chance to sharpen my public speaking skills and discover the deep 
                satisfaction that comes with teaching and mentoring others. These experiences have shaped me into a more confident leader and prepared me for 
                future challenges ahead.

            <p><u><b>Datafest</b></u></p>

            <p> <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/">Datafest</a> is an annual competition where undergraduate students from multiple universities team up to analyze big data and provide actionable insights 
                within just 48 hours. I had the privilege of participating each year when I was in college, and it was an exciting challenge that pushed both my
                 creativity and technical skills. The competition required me to navigate complex data and tackle open-ended questions with no clear solutions. Not only 
                 that, but I also had to learn how to collaborate with a team of varying skill levels, work in a fast-paced environment, and present my findings to a large 
                 audience. </p>
