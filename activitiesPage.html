            <p><u><b>Women in Data Science (WiDS)</b></u></p>
            
            <p><a href="https://www.widsconference.org/">WiDS</a> is an initiative founded by faculty members of Stanford University that aims to inspire and educate data scientists
                worldwide, and to support women in the field. I became a <a href="https://www.widsconference.org/ambassadors-2022.html">WiDS Ambassador</a> in 2021 and hosted the inaugural
                Riverside regional event at the Univeristy of California, Riverside. We had women from multiple industries and the academic space join us to share
                their insights and give advice to students in their undergraduate studies. Sessions included a keynote speaker, panels, and R/Python workshops! Due to the success of the 
                first event, we held another WiDS Regional event the following year!
            </p>

            <p><u><b>Highlander Statistics Society (HiSS)</b></u></p>

            <p> HiSS is an undergraduate club for students who are majoring or interested in statistics! People from various
                academic and personal backgrounds collected and collaborated on hands-on learning opportunities to practice their technical skills, 
                and gain the confidence in data analysis that is needed in the job market. HiSS strives to be an inclusive and supportive
                community by providing both personal and professional resources to help its members succeed in college.
            </p>

            <p> I was extremely fortunate to have been able to serve as President for two years because I had the time to better develop events,
                fine-tune the coding workshops, and organize the internal side of the club. Personally, I am grateful to have had this opportunity
                to grow as a leader, learn how to manage a team of five officers, polish my public speaking skills, and discover the joys 
                of teaching!

            <p><u><b><a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/" style="color: #000000;">Datafest</a></b></u></p>

            <p> <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/" style="color: #000000;">Datafest</a> is an annual competition where undergraduate students from multiple universities team up to analyze big data and provide actionable insights 
                within just 48 hours. I had the privilege of participating each year when I was in college, and it was an exciting challenge that pushed both my
                 creativity and technical skills. The competition required me to navigate complex data and tackle open-ended questions with no clear solutions. Not only 
                 that, but I also had to learn how to collaborate with a team of varying skill levels, work in a fast-paced environment, and present my findings to a large 
                 audience. </p>
