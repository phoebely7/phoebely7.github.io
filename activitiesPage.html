            <p><u><b>Highlander Statistics Society (HiSS)</b></u></p>

            <p> HiSS is an undergraduate club for students who are majoring or interested in statistics! People from various
                academic and personal backgrounds collected and collaborated on hands-on learning opportunities to practice their technical skills, 
                and gain the confidence in data analysis that is needed in the job market. HiSS strives to be an inclusive and supportive
                community by providing both personal and professional resources to help its members succeed in college.
            </p>

            <p> I was extremely fortunate to have been able to serve as President for two years because I had the time to better develop events,
                fine-tune the coding workshops, and organize the internal side of the club. Personally, I am grateful to have had this opportunity
                to grow as a leader, learn how to manage a team of five officers, polish my public speaking skills, and discover the joys 
                of teaching!
            </p>

            <p><u><b>Women in Data Science (WiDS)</b></u></p>
            
            <p>WiDS is an initiative founded by faculty members of Stanford University that aims to inspire and educate data scientists
                worldwide, and to support women in the field. I became a WiDS Ambassador in 2021 and collaborated with two Professors 
                from UCR to host an all-day, virtual event in Riverside, where we had a women from industry and academia join us to share
                their insights and advice to everyone in attendance. Sessions included a keynote speaker, panels, and R/Python workshops!
            </p>

            <p> <b>* WiDS Riverside 2022 * </b>is in the works! We are hoping to be able to host the event in-person; however that would all depend on the severity
                of the COVID-19 pandemic.
