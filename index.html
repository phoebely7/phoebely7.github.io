            <p>Hello! My name is Phoebe Ly and I recently graduated from UC Riverside with a B.S in 
                Pure Statistics with a minor in Computer Science. I am currently a Research Assistant in
                Professor David Lobell's Lab in the Center of Food Security and the Environment 
                (<a href="https://lobell-lab.stanford.edu/">FSE</a>)  at Stanford University. </p>

            <p>My research interests include examining soil mechanics and agriculture, using modern tools such as remote sensing
                and machine learning, to understand its impact on public health. This past summer, I had the privilege of being
                a <a href="https://earth.stanford.edu/dei/surge#gs.8korhj"> Stanford SURGE</a> scholar where I got to explore this field.</p>
            
            <p>During my time in college, I wanted to make efforts towards bridging the gap between the undergraduate students
                and the faculty within the Department of Statistics. Toward this aim, I led a number of research projects that 
                gave students the opportunity to connect with professors, as well as host Department panels to foster conversations. 
                Addionally, I served as a member of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee to brainstorm 
                initiatives to further improve the Department.</p>

            <p>During my free time, I love to create digital art, bake croissants, and purchase overpriced drinks at my local coffee shop!</p>
