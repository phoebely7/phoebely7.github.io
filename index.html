            <p>Hello! My name is Phoebe Ly and I am currently a geospatial data analyst at <a href="https://www.atlasai.co/">Atlas AI</a>,
                a cutting-edge GeoAI startup focused on leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and geospatial data to identify future 
                opportunities across a variety of industries. </p>
                
                <p>With a background in data analytics, remote sensing, and academic research, I have had the privilege of contributing to impactful projects 
                that spans multiple domains. This includes improving global nutrition programs, where AI technologies 
                are used to identify likely presence of zero-dose children; demand forecasting, where I have developed and applied predictive models to help retail businesses 
                plan for consumer needs; and aviation analytics, where I have been involved in expanding sustainable aviation technologies, such as zero-emission aircrafts, 
                through data-driven insights.</p>

                <p>I graduated from UC Riverside in 2021 with a B.S in Pure Statistics with a minor in Computer Science. My skills are highly
                transferrable across a variety of domains, but I am primarily interested in opportunities that have the potential to make a meaningful impact in global development 
                and sustainability. I am optimistic about leveraging geospatial data and machine learning to drive innovation and continuously seek opportunities to expand my 
                technical expertise while exploring new fields where these technologies can be applied.
                </p>
